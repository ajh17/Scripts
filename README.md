# Scripts

Various automation scripts for use with macOS' Spotlight.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/ajh17/Scripts.git /Applications/

You can of course replace `/Applications/` with any path of your choosing provided
you haven't told Spotlight not to index that path.

## Usage

You can place them in any directory that Spotlight indexes for easy execution
with Spotlight in macOS.

This was created in order to make Spotlight behave slightly more like Alfred.
The scripts use the new JavaScript for Automation in macOS.

### Descriptions

1. LockScreen.app: Switches to the user account switcher and password locks the
   account.
2. OpenApps.app: Opens most used apps. Customizable by editing the main.scpt.
3. QuitAllApps.app: Quits all of the above apps opened by OpenApps.app.
4. MacVim.app: Opens MacVim. No need to symlink MacVim to the /Applications
   directory.
5. Playground.app: Quickly create and open a new Swift Playground file.
6. EmptyTrash.app: Empty the trash. Caution: Currently shows no alert dialog.
7. Incognito.app: Open Chrome in birthday shopping mode. If it's already open,
   switches to it.
8. SwitchGraphics.app: Toggle between "Automatic graphics switching" setting in
   System Preferences. Gives you a notification when switched.
8. ToggleFunctionKeys.app: Toggles between standard function keys and Apple
   function key modes. Gives you a notification when switched.
9. CopyVersionInfo.app: Copies the macOS version information which includes the
   build number.
10. OpenTerminalHere.app: Opens Terminal.app pointed at the current Finder window's
    path. Can also be used on the Desktop itself! Note: If you want to open
    iTerm.app instead, edit the main.scpt file for this application.
11. Cleanupesktop.app: Messy Desktop? Move all the folders and files (excluding
    the hidden ones) from ~/Desktop to ~/Downloads instead

## FAQ

> Why not just use Alfred/Quicksilver?

Spotlight comes built in, is free, and can do most of what Alfred or Quicksilver
can do. Alfred charges for extra workflow features and it actually relies on
Spotlight's engine and metadata it creates for most of the heavy lifting. Most
people just want a app launcher with some workflow features. The Spotlight in
macOS is more accurate in opening apps, and can even do conversions. So why not
write automation scripts for it to execute?
